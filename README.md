Online food ordering is the process of ordering food from a website. The product can either be food that has been specially prepared for direct consumption (such as vegetables straight from a farm or garden, frozen meats, etc.) or food that has not been (such as direct from a certified home-kitchen, restaurant). The effort to create an online food ordering system aims to replace the manual method of taking orders with a digital one. The ability to rapidly and correctly create order summary reports whenever necessary is a key factor in the development of this project.
